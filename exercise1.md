In a team of six developers actively working on a Java application nearing release, setting up a CI/CD pipeline is crucial to ensure quality, maintain consistency, and reduce the struggle of managing code changes. A standard CI workflow in the Java ecosystem includes linting, testing, and building.

For linting, tools like Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs are commonly used. Checkstyle helps enforce coding standards, while PMD and SpotBugs can detect code smells, bugs, and potential performance issues.

Testing in Java is typically handled using JUnit, which is the most widely adopted testing framework. For mocking and behavior-driven testing, tools like Mockito and AssertJ are often used together. Code coverage tools such as JaCoCo help ensure sufficient test coverage.

Building and dependency management in Java is usually handled using Maven or Gradle. Both tools can compile code, run tests, and package the application into a deployable format. Additionally, they support numerous plugins that can perform specialized tasks during the build phase.

While Jenkins and GitHub Actions are widely used CI tools, other alternatives include GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, TeamCity, and Bitbucket Pipelines. Each has its strengths; for example, CircleCI is known for its performance and parallelism, while TeamCity offers advanced build configurations and integrations.

When it comes to deployment, the decision between a self-hosted and cloud-based CI setup depends on the teamâ€™s needs. Cloud-based solutions are easier to set up and maintain, making them ideal for small teams like this one. However, self-hosted CI might be more suitable for organizations with strict security or compliance requirements.
